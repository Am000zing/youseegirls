"I woke to the sunlight streaming through the blinds and the loud sound of machinery outside the window."
"*Yawn*"
"I stretched and peeked through the blinds. There was a man mowing the lawn, and another blowing leaves away."
"I checked the time"
"It's 8 AM! I woke up so early..."
"Man, jet-lag is one hell of a sucker."

"I did my morning routine: brushing my teeth, washing my face, did my hair..."
"I'm so excited what might happen today!"
"I exited the dorms, and made my way to the parking lot where I supposed to meet up with Mio."

"Oh? He isn't here yet?"
"I checked the time..."
"It's 9:50AM."
"Maybe he's running a bit late. I'll just wait around for him."

"Close by, a car screeched into a parking space."
"Wow! It's so glossy-looking..."
"And a Mercedes? S-Class? I didn't realize people enjoyed their wealth on their sleeve, not that it's up to me to decide."
"A girl stepped out, dressed in her school uniform with a large oversized jacket on top."
"Her large sunglasses covered half her face. How could she possibly hold her head up with such large, heavy glasses?"
"In her hand was a cup of boba milk tea."
"She took a sip as she shut her car door, but then suddenly she sounded like she, quite loudly, had a hard time breathing."

menu:
    "Check out if she's okay.":
        "I head over to check on her. Maybe she choked on her drink!"
    "Stay where you are.":
        "Her lurching sounds grow louder. I think she's choking!"
        "I decide to head over to her and not be a degenerate bystander."

N "Hey, are you alright?"
"She looks up, her face becoming a bit blue and tears in her eyes."
"Oh no, she's dying!"
"Thinking fast, I come up with a solution to attempt to save her."
N "Okay, this might hurt a bit, but I'll try to help you!"
"I slapped her back with all my might-"

"-And out came a tapioca pearl!"
"Her sunglasses nearly came off with how hard I slapped her back but god knows what would've happened if I didn't help though..."
"She slowly straightened herself up, adjusting her glasses and her jacket."
"She's breathing a bit heavily..."
"Oh no, maybe I hit her too hard?"

menu:

        N "Sorry about suddenly hitting you so hard."

N "W-why? It's fine I don't need it"
unknown "No, I insist. It's for saving my life."

"I guess I just got $20...?"
unknown "By the way, what's your name?"

Irene "Well, I'm Irene. Hope to see you around sometime."
N "Yeah, see you around!"
"She left the parking lot and walked into campus, sipping on her boba."
